Patching Vortek's BCn decoder

This project implements the BCn decompression fixes as discussed in https://github.com/brunodev85/winlator/issues/852, in particular, most/all glitches related to compressed textures on Mali and some Adreno 6XX devices should be fixed.

These fixes will be implemented directly in the next version of Winlator (I only discovered them in parallel coincidentally), but you can use this debug build to try them out ahead of time in https://github.com/leegao/vortek-patcher/releases/tag/v0
